      " I recently decided to switch my carrier to AI engineer. I have finished extensive machine learning online course on Udemy by Super DataScience team. So, I have almost finished Deep learning and am in the middle of Mathematical foundation courses provided ZTM online academy and Super DataScience Team. I have completed many real world project like food vision and Skimlit NLP project in the process with Deep learning (please check my GitHub repo on deep learning to check out my projects). I have some understanding and done projects and fine tunned on LLM (especially on Llama-3b-instruct) on my own custom dataset. I am planning to master reinforcement learning, Deep reinforcement learning, Deep Q learning in future. âž” Please checmy GitHub to track my progress.",

      " I recently decided to pursue my passion of Data science and Artificial Intelligence. I have finished extensive machine learning online course on Udemy by Super DataScience team. I have also completed Deep learning Tensorflow course by ZTM academy and I am in the middle of Mathematical foundation course bySuper DataScience Team. I have completed many real world project like Nepali GPT (training open source model to understand new language), food vision and Skimlit NLP project in the process with Deep learning (please check my GitHub repo on deep learning to check out my projects). I have some understanding and done projects and fine tunned on LLM (especially on transformer architecture) on my own custom dataset. I am planning to master reinforcement learning, Deep reinforcement learning, Deep Q learning in future. âž” Please checmy GitHub to track my progress.",
